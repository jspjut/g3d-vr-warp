This project is an approach to build a custom lens distortion function on top of G3D's standard VR starter project. 

The current plan of attack is to complete the following steps:

[x] Copy VR Starter
[ ] Extend OpenVR with custom class
[ ] Disable OpenVR distortion function
[ ] Render fixed grid to capture lens distortion
[ ] Iterate on correction pass until it's close
